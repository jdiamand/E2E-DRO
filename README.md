# End-to-end distributionally robust optimization

This repository presents an end-to-end (E2E) model learning framework where the final decision layer is based on a distributionally robust optimizatiion (DRO) model. This repository was created by Giorgio Costa and Garud Iyengar and is part of Iyengar Lab in the IEOR Department at Columbia University. This is currently a work-in-progress project.
