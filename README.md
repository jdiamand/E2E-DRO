# End-to-end distributionally robust optimization

This repository presents an end-to-end (E2E) model learning framework where the final decision layer is based on a distributionally robust optimizatiion (DRO) model. This repository was created by [Giorgio Costa](https://gcosta151.github.io) and [Garud Iyengar](http://www.columbia.edu/~gi10/) and hosted under Iyengar Lab in the IEOR Department at Columbia University. This is currently a work-in-progress project.
